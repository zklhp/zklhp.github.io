the eye is a fascinating topic that has been studied by scientists for many years. It is believed that the first eyes appeared in animals over 600 million years ago, and they were likely simple in design and function. Over time, the eyes of animals became more complex and specialized, and eventually led to the development of the eyes of humans and other animals today. The evolution of the eye has been influenced by a variety of factors, including changes in the environment, the development of predators and prey, and the need for improved vision in different environments.</p><p><strong>Quantized (Q4_1), load in 7 s</strong><br>tell me more about the evolution of the eye<br>Response: The evolution of the eye has been a fascinating subject of study in evolutionary biology and animal behavior. The evolution of the eye has been linked to the evolution of behavior and adaptation to the environment. The earliest eyes, which are thought to have evolved in organisms about 600 million years ago, were simple light-detecting organs that could detect the presence of light and darkness. These early eyes had no lens or cornea, but they did have a layer of light-sensitive cells that could detect light. Over time, the evolution of the eye continued to evolve in various directions, leading to the development of more complex eyes in various organisms. The eyes of many organisms today are highly complex, with a variety of structures and cells that work together to detect light and provide information about the environment to the organism. The evolution of the eye has been a fascinating subject of study in evolutionary biology and animal behavior, and it continues to be a subject of research and discussion today.</p><p><strong>Quantized (Q4_0), load in 6 s</strong><br>tell me more about the evolution of the eye<br>Response: The evolution of the eye is a complex and fascinating story that spans millions of years. The earliest evidence of eyes dates back to the Cambrian Period, over 550 million years ago. At this time, animals were primarily marine and their eyes were small and simple, likely used for detecting light and avoiding predators. Over time, animals developed more complex eyes that could detect color and depth perception. These eyes allowed animals to hunt more efficiently and avoid predators. However, the evolution of the eye was not a simple linear process. Many animals lost their eyes and developed other adaptations to take advantage of their surroundings. For example, insects and birds lost their eyes but developed other sensory organs to take over their sensory abilities. The evolution of the eye is an ongoing process that continues to this day.</p><p><strong>Quantized (Q4_1_O), load in 6 s</strong><br>tell me more about the evolution of the eye<br>Response: The evolution of the eye is a fascinating topic in biology. The earliest forms of eyes were likely simple light-sensitive spots that were used for light detection. These light-sensitive spots are thought to  have evolved in the earliest forms of life, such as single-celled organisms. As more complex organisms evolved, the eye became more complex, with multiple layers of cells and specialized tissues.</p><footer><strong>RWKV-4-Raven-14B-v8-Eng-20230408-ctx4096</strong></footer></blockquote><p><a href="https://github.com/saharNooby/rwkv.cpp/issues/22">https://github.com/saharNooby/rwkv.cpp/issues/22</a></p><h2 id="模拟一个人的思维需要多少个参数？">模拟一个人的思维需要多少个参数？</h2><p>一个人，从出生到死亡，80年一刻不停的学习，1 s学1 token，是</p><p>$$ N_{token} = 80 \times 365 \times 24 \times 3600 = 2.5 \times 10^{9} $$</p><p>就是说，一个人的参数大概就是25亿，就是2.5 B。现在的模型都能达到65 B，远超人类的认知水平了。</p><h2 id="til-武大郎卖的是馒头">[TIL]武大郎卖的是馒头</h2><p><a href="https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/157303153">https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/157303153</a></p><p>作者考据功力深厚。</p><h2 id="33万pv达成">33万PV达成</h2><p>As of 2023-04-06.</p><h2 id="wslg-wayland-bug">WSLg Wayland bug</h2><p><a href="https://github.com/microsoft/wslg/issues/1032">https://github.com/microsoft/wslg/issues/1032</a></p><h2 id="长周期耐用消费品">长周期耐用消费品</h2><ul><li>人矿</li><li>韭菜</li><li><a href="/2022/11/08/Recent-thoughts-2022-11-08/#%E8%BD%AF%E8%82%8B">软肋</a></li></ul><h2 id="til-根据-台灣雀巢股份有限公司-一杯-1-8-g-醇品風味咖啡里面含有55-6-mg咖啡因">[TIL]根据 台灣雀巢股份有限公司，一杯(1.8 g)醇品風味咖啡里面含有55.6 mg咖啡因</h2><p><a href="http://www.chiafeng.com.tw/upload/doc/doc_20171021022119_0.pdf">http://www.chiafeng.com.tw/upload/doc/doc_20171021022119_0.pdf</a></p><script async src="//cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/3dmol@1.7.1/build/3Dmol-min.min.js" onload="backend_loaded()"></script><div id="container" class="mol-container" style="width:100%; height:0; position: relative"></div><textarea id="coordinates" title="attributes" rows="10" style="width: 100%; max-width: 100%;">Loading...

id="金庸先生的-笑傲江湖-虽然是武侠小说">金庸先生的《笑傲江湖》虽然是武侠小说</h2><p>对日月神教的描述非常有讽刺意味。</p><blockquote><p>任我行兴高采烈，说道：“东方不败捉拿童百熊，黑木崖上自是吵翻了天，咱们乘这时候上崖，当真最好不过。”向问天道：“咱们请上官兄弟一起来商议商议。”任我行点头道：“甚好。”向问天转身出房，随即和上官云一起进来。上官云一见任我行，便即躬身行礼，说道：“属下上官云，参见教主，教主千秋万载，一统江湖。”任我行笑道：“上官兄弟，向来听说你是个不爱说话的硬汉子，怎地今日初次见面，却说这等话？”上官云一愣，道：“属下不明，请教主指点。”</p><p>盈盈道：“爹爹，你听上官叔叔说‘教主千秋万载，一统江湖’，觉得这句话很突兀，是不是？”任我行道：“甚么千秋万载，一统江湖，当我是秦始皇吗？”</p><p>盈盈微笑道：“这是东方不败想出来的玩意儿，他要下属众人见到他时，都说这句话，就是他不在跟前，教中兄弟们互相见面之时，也须这么说。那还是不久之前搞的花样。上官叔叔说惯了，对你也这么说了。”</p><p>任我行点头道：“原来如此。千秋万载，一统江湖，倒想得挺美！但又不是神仙，哪里有千秋万载的事？上官兄弟，听说东方不败下了令要捉拿童老，料想黑木崖上甚是混乱，咱们今晚便上崖去，你说如何？”</p><p>上官云道：“教主令旨英明，算无遗策，烛照天下，造福万民，战无不胜，攻无不克。属下谨奉令旨，忠心为主，万死不辞。”</p><p>任我行心下暗自嘀咕：“江湖上多说‘雕侠’上官云武功既高，为人又极耿直，怎地说起话来满口谀词，陈腔烂调，直似个不知廉耻的小人？难道江湖上传闻多误，他只是浪得虚名？”不由得皱起了眉头。</p><p>盈盈笑道：“爹爹，咱们要混上黑木崖去，第一自须易容改装，别给人认了出来。可是更要紧的，却得学会一套黑木崖上的切口，否则你开口便错。”任我行道：“甚么叫做黑木崖上的切口？”盈盈道：“上官叔叔说的甚么‘教主令旨英明，算无遗策’，甚么‘属下谨奉令旨，忠心为主，万死不辞’等等，便是近年来在黑木崖上流行的切口。这一套都是杨莲亭那厮想出来奉承东方不败的。他越听越喜欢，到得后来，只要有人不这么说，便是大逆不道的罪行，说得稍有不敬，立时便有杀身之祸。”任我行道：“你见到东方不败之时，也说这些狗屁吗？”盈盈道：“身在黑木崖上，不说又有甚么法子？女儿所以常在洛阳城中住，便是听不得这些叫人生气的言语。”</p><p>任我行道：“上官兄弟，咱们之间，今后这一套全都免了。”上官云道：“是。教主指示圣明，历百年而常新，垂万世而不替，如日月之光，布于天下，属下自当凛遵。”</p><p>盈盈抿着嘴，不敢笑出声来。</p><p>任我行道：“你说咱们该当如何上崖才好？”上官云道：“教主胸有成竹，神机妙算，当世无人能及万一。教主座前，属下如何敢参末议？”任我行皱眉道：“东方不败会商教中大事之时，也是无人敢发一言吗？”盈盈道：“东方不败才智超群，别人原不及他的见识。就算有人想到甚么话，那也是谁都不敢乱说，免遭飞来横祸。”</p><p>……</p><p>银铃声从高而下的响将下来，十分迅速，铃声止歇不久，一名身穿黄衣的教徒走进来，双手展开一幅黄布，读道：“日月神教文成武德、仁义英明教主东方令曰：贾布、上官云遵奉令旨，成功而归，殊堪嘉尚，着即带同俘虏，上崖进见。”上官云躬身道：“教主千秋万载，一统江湖。”</p><p>令狐冲见了这情景，暗暗好笑：“这不是戏台上太监宣读圣旨吗？”</p><p>只听上官云大声道：“教主赐属下进见，大恩大德，永不敢忘。”他属下众人一齐说道：“教主赐属下进见，大恩大德，永不敢忘。”</p><p>……</p><p>这几句话，其实是当面在骂杨莲亭，可是他哪里知道，笑道：“很好，教中众兄弟倘若都能像你上官长老一般，对教主忠心耿耿，何愁大事不成？你辛苦了，这就下去休息罢。”上官云一怔，说道：“属下很想参见教主。属下每见教主金面一次，便觉精神大振，做事特别有劲，全身发热，似乎功力修为陡增十年。”</p><p>杨莲亭淡淡一笑，说道：“教主很忙，恐怕没空见你。”上官云探手入怀，伸出来时，掌心中已多了十来颗大珍珠，走上几步，低声道：“杨总管，属下这次出差，弄到了这十八颗珍珠，尽数孝敬了总管，只盼总管让我参见教主。教主一喜欢，说不定升我的职，那时再当重重酬谢。”</p><p>杨莲亭皮笑肉不笑的道：“自己兄弟，又何必这么客气？那可多谢你了。”放低了喉咙道：“教主座前，我尽力替你多说好话，劝他升你做青龙堂长老便了。”</p><p>上官云连连作揖，说道：“此事若成，上官云终身不敢忘了教主和总管的大恩大德。”杨莲亭道：“你在这里等着，待教主有空，便叫你进去。”上官云道：“是，是，是！”将珍珠塞在他的手中，躬身退下。杨莲亭站起身来，大模大样的进内去了。</p><p>又过良久，一名紫衫侍者走了出来，居中一站，朗声说道：“文成武德、仁义英明教主有令：着白虎堂长老上官云带同俘虏进见。”</p><p>上官云道：“多谢教主恩典，愿教主千秋万载，一统江湖。”左手一摆，跟着那紫衫人向后进走去。任我行和向问天、盈盈抬了令狐冲跟在后面。</p><p>……</p><p>杨莲亭笑道：“教主宝训第三条是甚么？你读来听听！”童百熊重重“呸”了一声，并不答话。杨莲亭道：“童家各人听了，哪一个知道教主宝训第三条的，念出来听听。”</p><p>一个十岁左右的男孩说道：“文成武德、仁义英明教主宝训第三条：‘对敌须狠，斩草除根，男女老幼，不留一人。”杨莲亭道：“很好，很好！小娃娃，十条教主宝训，你都背得出吗？”那男孩道：“都背得出。一天不读教主宝训，就吃不下饭，睡不着觉。读了教主宝训，练武有长进，打仗有气力。”</p><p>杨莲亭笑道：“很对，这话是谁教你的？”那男孩道：“爸爸教的。”杨莲亭指着童百熊道：“他是谁？”那男孩道：“是爷爷。”杨莲亭道：“你爷爷不读教主宝训，不听教主的话，反而背叛教主，你说怎么样？”那男孩道：“爷爷不对。每个人都应该读教主宝训，听教主的话。”</p><p>杨莲亭向童百熊道：“你孙儿只是个十岁娃娃，尚且明白道理。你这大把年纪，怎地反而胡涂了？”</p><p>……</p><p>令狐冲这时已退到殿口，与教主的座位相距已遥，灯光又暗，远远望去，任我行的容貌已颇为朦胧，心下忽想：“坐在这位子上的，是任我行还是东方不败，却有甚么分别？”只听得各堂堂主和香主赞颂之辞越说越响，显然众人心怀极大恐惧，自知过去十余年来为东方不败尽力，言语之中，更不免有得罪前任教主之处，今日任教主重登大位，倘若要算旧帐，不知会受到如何惨酷的刑罚。更有一干新进，从来不知任我行是何等人，只知努力奉承东方不败和杨莲亭便可升职免祸，料想换了教主仍是如此，是以人人大声颂扬。令狐冲站在殿口，太阳光从背后射来，殿外一片明朗，阴暗的长殿之中却是近百人伏在地下，口吐颂辞。他心下说不出厌恶，寻思：“盈盈对我如此，她如真要我加盟日月神教，我原非顺她之意不可。等得我去了嵩山，阻止左冷禅当上五嶽派的掌门，对方证大师和冲虚道长二位有了交代，再在恒山派中选出女弟子来接任掌门，我身一获自由，加盟神教，也可商量。可是要我学这些人的样，岂不是枉自为人？我日后娶盈盈为妻，任教主是我岳父，向他磕头跪拜，那是应有之义，可是甚么‘中兴圣教，泽被苍生’，甚么‘文成武德，仁义英明’，男子汉大丈夫整日价说这些无耻的言语，当真玷污了英雄豪杰的清白！我当初只道这些无聊的玩意儿，只是东方不败与杨莲亭所想出来折磨人的手段，但瞧这情形，任教主听着这些谀词，竟也欣然自得，丝毫不觉得肉麻！”</p><p>又想：“当日在华山思过崖后洞石壁之上，见到魔教十长老所刻下的武功，曾想魔教前辈之中，着实有不少英雄好汉。若非如此，日月教焉能与正教抗衡百年，互争雄长，始终不衰？即以当世之士而论，向大哥、上官云、贾布、童百熊、孤山梅庄中的江南四友，哪一个不是奇材杰出之士？这样一群豪杰之士，身处威逼之下，每日不得不向一个人跪拜，口中念念有辞，心底暗暗诅咒。言者无耻，受者无礼。其实受者逼人行无耻之事，自己更加无耻。这等屈辱天下英雄，自己又怎能算是英雄好汉？”</p><p>只听得任我行洋洋得意的声音从长殿彼端传了出来，说道：“你们以前都在东方不败手下服役，所干过的事，本教主暗中早已查得清清楚楚，一一登录在案。但本教主宽大为怀，既往不咎。今后只须大家尽忠本教主，本教主自当善待尔等，共享荣华富贵。”</p><p>瞬时之间，殿中颂声大作，都说教主仁义盖天，胸襟如海，大人不计小人过，众部属自当谨奉教主令旨，忠字当头，赴汤蹈火，万死不辞，立下决心，为教主尽忠到底。</p><p>任我行待众人说了一阵，声音渐渐静了下来，又道：“但若有谁胆敢作逆造反，不服令旨，那便严惩不贷。一人有罪，全家老幼凌迟处死。”众人齐声道：“属下万万不敢。”令狐冲听这些人话声颤抖，显是十分害怕，暗道：“任教主还是和东方不败一样，以恐惧之心威慑教众。众人面子上恭顺，心底却愤怒不服，这个‘忠’字，从何说起？”只听得有人向任我行揭发东方不败的罪恶，说他如何忠言逆耳，偏信杨莲亭一人，如何滥杀无辜，赏罚有私，爱听恭维的言语，祸乱神教。有人说他败坏本教教规，乱传黑木令，强人服食三尸脑神丸。另有一人说他饮食穷侈极欲，吃一餐饭往往宰三头牛、五口猪、十口羊。</p><p>令狐冲心道：“一个人食量再大，又怎食得三头牛、五口猪、十口羊？他定是宴请朋友或是与众部属同食。东方不败身为一教之主，宰几头牛羊，又怎算是甚么大罪？”</p><p>但听各人所提东方不败罪名，越来越多，也越来越加琐碎。有人骂他喜怒无常，哭笑无端；有人骂他爱穿华服，深居不出。更有人说他见识肤浅，愚蠢胡涂；另有一人说他武功低微，全仗装腔作势吓人，其实没半分真实本领。</p><p>令狐冲寻思：“你们指骂东方不败如何如何，我也不知你们说得对不对。可是适才我们五人敌他一人，个个死里逃生，险些儿尽数命丧他绣花针下。倘若东方不败武功低微，世上更无一个武功高强之人了。当真是胡说八道之至。”</p><p>接着又听一人说东方不败荒淫好色，强抢民女，淫辱教众妻女，生下私生子无数。</p><p>令狐冲心想：“东方不败为练《葵花宝典》中的奇功，早已自宫，甚么淫辱妇女，生下私生子无数，哈哈，哈哈！”他想到这里，再也忍耐不住，不由得笑出声来。</p><footer><strong>金庸</strong><cite>《笑傲江湖》</cite></footer></blockquote><p>正因如此，金庸先生说「本书没有历史背景」，「类似的情景可以发生在任何朝代」。</p><p>另，据说日月神教在最初的连载版里叫「朝阳神教」。</p><h2
